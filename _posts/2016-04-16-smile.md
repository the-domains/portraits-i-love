# portraits I love

This site is dedicated to sharing portraits that I love. Many of the images are mine, but others are treasures I have found on the web as I study the craft of photography. These images inspire me with their creativity, lighting, posing and all that goes into making great/timeless portraits. Photographer and model are sites when known.
